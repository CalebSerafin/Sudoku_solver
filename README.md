# Sudoku_solver
Solves all the world's hardest Sudoku puzzles including all from Dr. Arto Inkala, U  of Helsinki (professor of mathematics).
I recompiled the C++ source code Sudoku_solver.cpp with static linking of run-time libraries in Visual Studio so it is not necessary to have Visual Studio installed to run it.

Note: This proram makes use of two c++11 libraries: 

#include <chrono>
#include <random>

This is done so that the wonderful 64 bit Mersenne twister random number generator mt19937_64 generator(gseed); can be used. The standard C++ rand(seed) is uselessly unrandom.  This is  transparent though since those two libraries are statically linked. Initial seed is derived from the system clock.


To change it to run in a Linux environment requires editing the Sudoku_solver.cpp file and editing 2 lines to change _tmain to main and then recompiling with gcc.

It has two modes of operation:

Mode 1: Manual input mode.

Mode 2: websudoku.com page scrape mode.

In mode 1, a puzzle can be manually typed and saved in a file named i.txt which must reside in the same Windows directory in which the program Sudoku_solver.exe is located. Blanks must be represented with zeroes and each number must be separated by a space.

Mode 1 Example 1:

Suppose you want to see if the program can solve a Sudoku puzzle with the theoretical minimum number of clues, which is 17 clues:

Please note: There are 17 clue puzzles which have no valid solution (invalid puzzle). There are also puzzles with 17 clues which have multiple solutions (invalid puzzle). There are no Sudoku puzzles which have less than 17 clues which only have one unique solution (valid puzzle).

Step 1: Download "Sudoku_solver.exe" and "17clues" from this gitHub repository.

It is impossible for this program to output a wrong answer for any puzzle with only one solution. This is accomplished by checksumming each row, column and box in the answer output. See above. All values will add up to 45 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9 = 45.

If a wrong answer had been calculated,  several rows,columns and boxes would would have oddball summations like 43, 41, 46 etc.

Since only results summing up to 45 are allowed, wrong answers are thusly prohibited.

A Sudoku puzzle contains 9 rows of 9 numbers.  81 numbers total. The puzzle can be viewed as 9 rows of 9, 9 columns of 9, 9 3 x 3 boxes of 9 numbers each, 3 "row units" of 3 horizontal 3 x 3 boxes or 3 "column units" of 3 vertical 3 x 3 boxes or a single 2-dimensional 9 x 9 array of digits 1 through 9.

Type sudoku. It will be the first website. Pick an EASY puzzle.

The program will scrape the selected puzzle off the website if you right click  “view frame source” and then right click and save frame source as whatever file Chrome picks. 

When the frame source is saved, it must be saved as “HTML only” instead of “complete web page”.

Once that file is saved to your download directory, close the frame html tab and open a dos command prompt window (I know. The heuristic “human approach” algorithms used up all the juice on “back end”). Path needs to be your download path like C:\users\me\Desktop.Wherever you put solveit.

Type solveit and it will be solved in 0 seconds, most likely. You can type the puzzle into to the web page to check it if you like to see if the answer is right, but it is a waste of time. The program will never display an incorrect answer. It is not possible. A valid Sudoku puzzle has only one correct solution and my program does a check of rows, columns and boxes and they must all add up to 45. Scroll back and you can see the verification checksum.

Pick a medium puzzle.

Right click “view frame source”.  

Right click “save as”  chrome default filename and “HTML only” file type (should already be filled in).

Close the HTML tab. Resize the puzzle on the left and the dos window on the right.

Up arrow and enter (solveit)

Probably zero seconds.

Pick a hard puzzle.

Repeat medium steps as above.

Probably 0 or maybe 1 second depending on how slow you computer is.

Pick an EVIL puzzle same thing.

You could do this a million times and this program will never fail or give a wrong answer.

See image files for Chrome websudoku.com puzzle page scrape instructions and manual puzzle input instructions.

It is written in C++ (C++11 library for Marsenne Twister random number generator) and compiles with no warnings in Visual Studio. Since I recompiled it with static linking of needed runtime DLLs, it is a stand-alone exe. 

It can solve the hardest Sudoku puzzles in the world.

A lot of email providers don’t like or allow .EXE files to be sent as mail attachments, so copying it from my  Github is the easiest:
